Graphical Algorithmic Breeding of L-grammars in Environments (GABLE)

The goal of this program is to generate 3-D models of plants based on fractals. These fractals are generated from grammars
with rules that simulate the rules plants follow when growing and blooming. To get some info on these beautiful math
structures just do a quick google search for L-grammars, or grammars first if your not familiar with the structure.

Requires JOGL to compile
